  "description": "Replaces Gnome's default virtual keyboard with Onboard. Instead of showing/hiding caribou this extension sends dbus commands to Onboard to show/hide.\n\nNote that you have to configure Onboard yourself to get a pleasing experience. See Onboard settings and dconf (org/onboard) for a variety of options. Very useful settins are: \n- dconf: org/onboard/window: docking-enabled=true, docking-edge=bottom, docking-shrink-workarea=true, force-to-top=true (helps with some ctrl-key in terminal annoyances)\n- dconf: org/onboard/window/landscape: dock-expand=true, set height to your liking\n\n\nTo easily bring up the onscreen keyboard in applications that don't support auto-show, see the \"Slide for Keyboard\" extension ( https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/993/slide-for-keyboard/ ).",
